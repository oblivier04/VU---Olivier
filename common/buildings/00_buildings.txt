#Victorum Universalis Note -
#There is no way to modify this carefully overriding parts of it.
#File has been documented well and organised to the best of our abilities. Any submods or addons desiring to add their own entries will need to manually update this entirely
#after every VU update. This is out of our hands and there are no suggestions for this.
#Furthermore, this file contains new entries throughout various sections and should not crash the game if said entries have been entered and linked correctly with respective files.
#Many thanks to you all - San Felipe.

# Do not change tags in here without changing every other reference to them.
# If adding new buildings, make sure they are uniquely named.

# cost = x #==> cost in $ to build (subject to other modifiers)
# time = x #==> number of months to build.
# modifier = m # a modifier on the province that the building gives
# trigger = t # an and trigger that needs to be fullfilled to build and keep the building
# one_per_country = yes/no # if yes, only one of these can exist in a country
# manufactory = { trade_good trade_good } # list of trade goods that get a production bonus
# onmap = yes/no # show as a sprite on the map

# FROM = owner
# ROOT = province

# Building AI is now mainly hard-coded. The AI will estimate how much it gains yearly from each building,
# convert the value to ducats, and take the building with biggest yearly return as a percentage of the build cost.
# If lower than 1%, the AI will not consider the yearly return worth it.
# It will also require higher yearly return if the economy in not in prime shape.
# Forts' value also get converted to a yearly return based on terrain and strategic position, as well as available budget for fort maintenance.

# AI can still be modded though; it will multiply the yearly return with the value of ai_will_do.
# If you don't want the AI to build a building at all, make ai_will_do become 0.
# AI will consider each building to be worth 0.01 ducats per year as a base, so making ai_will_do above cost will have them build it at some point.
# It will still check whether it can afford a building before doing so though, but may save up to it.
