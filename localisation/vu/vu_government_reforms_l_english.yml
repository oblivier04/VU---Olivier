Thankfully, this chaos most often proves very temporary, as one faction or another usually wins out within a few years and the nation returns to a more stable form of government."

Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between cousins."
