It seems that their neighbors, the Russians, want to take advantage of this situation. To prevent them becoming even more powerful, we must secure the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for ourselves by transferring it to us instead! Let the Swedish Deluge commence!"

 swe_improve_sweden_desc:0 "Sweden as a country is fairly undeveloped. Cities are mostly small parishes around a central church or marketplace. If we want to rise as a great power and rival the nations of Europe, our core lands need to be developed. While we're at it, let us give some of them some fitting names fitting our great state to further bolster [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s claim to the throne."
