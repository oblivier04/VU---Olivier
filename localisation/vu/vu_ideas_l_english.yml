 military_reconaissance: "Military Reconaissance"
 military_reconaissance_desc: "By deploying our spies as scouts on the battlefield, we can learn much about the layout of enemy territory, greatly informing the logistical and organizational planning of our military campaigns.

 gnv_watchmaking:0 "Centre of Watchmaking"
 gnv_watchmaking_desc:0 "Switzerland is famed for its expert watchmakers and Geneva itself has been known as one of the most prominent watchmaking cities in the world starting in the 16th century. Many prominent watchmakers have been based in Geneva, many of whom were previously employed as Goldsmiths before such activities were curtailed by John Calvin's reforms and many took up watchmaking as an alternate craft."

 gunpowder_empire_mug:0 "Mughal Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_mug_desc:0 "The Mughal Sultan Babur had employed Ottoman expert Ustad Ali Quli, who showed Babur the standard Ottoman formation—artillery and firearm-equipped infantry protected by wagons in the center, and mounted archers on both wings. Babur used this formation at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Afghan and Rajput forces loyal to the Delhi sultanate, though superior in numbers but without the gunpowder weapons, were soundly defeated.\n\nThe decisive victory of the Timurid forces is one reason opponents rarely met Mughal princes in pitched battle over the course of the empire's history. The reign of Akbar The Great, Shah Jahan and the Islamic Aurangzeb, represented the height of gunpowder use in Mughal history."
 gunpowder_empire_per:0 "Persian Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_per_desc:0 "Within two years of the disastrous defeat at Chaldiran, the Persian Shah Ismail had a corps of musketeers (tofangchi) numbering 8,000, and by 1521, possibly 20,000. After Abbas the Great reformed the army (around 1598), the Safavid forces had an artillery corps of 500 cannons as well as 12,000 musketeers.\n\nThe Safavids first put their gunpowder arms to good use against the Uzbeks, who had invaded eastern Persia during the civil war that followed the death of Ismail I. Their use would continue and thanks to these weapons, the Ottomans would no longer manage to secure another decisive victory against the Persians as they had at Chaldiran."
 gunpowder_empire_tur:0 "Ottoman Gunpowder"
 gunpowder_empire_tur_desc:0 "By the 15th century, use of gunpowder weapons propelled the Ottoman army as one of the strongest in the world. Their siege engines proved their worth in the successful siege of Salonica in 1430 and of Constantinople in 1453. The Janissaries had been an infantry bodyguard using bows and arrows. During the rule of Sultan Mehmed II they were drilled with firearms and became perhaps the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world.\n\nThe combination of artillery and Janissary firepower proved decisive at Varna in 1444 against a force of Crusaders, Baskent in 1473 against the Aq Qoyunlu, and Mohacs in 1526 against Hungary. But the battle which convinced the Safavids and the Mughals of the efficacy of gunpowder was Chaldiran in 1514, which led to the sack of the Safavid capital of Tabriz."

Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the syncretic religion has absorbed native elements. The reducciones flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, and it represents a defining moment for our nation and culture."
 PRG_idea3:0 "Develop the Land"
 PRG_idea3_desc:0 "The woodlands and hills of Paraguay have been the home of our ancestors for many years but prove a challenging environment: many colonists tried their fortune here only to be hampered by the harshness of the environment, a lack of proper supplies and an overconfidence of their own superiority. We, however, have mixed Guarani and European knowledge to be able to live and develop the land efficiently."
 PRG_idea4:0 "Protectionism and Centralism"
 PRG_idea4_desc:0 "Surrounded by many competitors it is important to extert control on all exports. Our government must follow protectionism, never accept loans from abroad and levy high tariffs against imported foreign products. This protectionism will make our society self-sufficient, and will avoid the debt that's plaguing some of our neighbors."

 CUB_idea6_desc:0 "The Tobacco and Sugar plantations in Cuba generated a tremendous amounth of wealth, the latter becoming the most important in the world in the 19th century.

 TNV_idea2:0 "The Three Hills"
 TNV_idea2_desc:0 "Tarnovo is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Sveta Gora, rising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. These hills were the main centers of kings and boyars during the Bulgarian Empire, and Sveta Gora (Holy Mountain) hill remains an important spiritual and literary center. Just as the hill's fortifications have protected us in the past, they shall do so again."
 TNV_idea3:0 "Centers of Learning"
 TNV_idea3_desc:0 "Prior to the Turkish invasions, Tarnovo was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, and to literature. It is important to restore these great centers of learning to their former glory if we don't want to be left behind."
 TNV_idea4:0 "Banks of the Yantra"
 TNV_idea4_desc:0 "The catchment area in the Balkan Range is afforested mainly with deciduous forests, and the Yantra catchment area is well wooded and grassed in its pre-mountainous section. Although prone to flooding, the waters of the Yantra provide us with much needed water for drinking and irrigation."
 TNV_idea5:0 "Columns of History"
 TNV_idea5_desc:0 "Some of the Bulgarian Empire's most significant historical records are stored in the Holy Forty Martyrs church in Tarnovo, including Omurtag's Column, Asen's Column and the Border Column from Rodosto from the rule of Khan Krum. These columns were placed in the church by Ivan Asen II as a tribute to his mighty ancestors."
 TNV_idea6:0 "Indomitable Will"
 TNV_idea6_desc:0 "Tarnovo remained the centre of resistance against the Ottoman empire long after the fall of Bulgaria, with several uprisings beginning from the city itself, particularly those of 1598, 1686 and - lastly - 1876. Even as the Ottomans continued to oppress Bulgaria, this only hardened the spirits of the patriots wishing to see the nation reborn anew. We must ensure to never again fall under the control of such tyrants."
 TNV_idea7:0 "Re-establish the Empire"

 BDN_idea1_desc:0 "Ever since the days of the Romans Vidin has been an important stronghold to protect imperial borders, and under the Empire of Bulgaria this was no exception, as the city was a bishop seat and capital of a large province, and its despots were influential figures in the Empire and were on several occasions chosen for Emperors."
 BDN_idea2:0 "Baba Vida"
 BDN_idea2_desc:0 "Vidin's main landmark, the Baba Vida fortress, was built in the period from the 10th to the 14th century, and served as the city's main defensive installation during the course of the Middle Ages and acted as the most important fortress of northwestern Bulgaria."
 BDN_idea3:0 "Defend against Serbia"
 BDN_idea3_desc:0 "Many times throughout history the Serbian kings to the west have desired to add Vidin and the surrounding areas to their possessions: even today we can never know when they will strike again. It is important to have a mobile army capable of intercepting them before they lay siege to the city once again."
 BDN_idea4:0 "Echoes of Freedom"
 BDN_idea4_desc:0 "Even after the Ottomans captured Vidin in 1388 and forced the then ruler Sratsimir to become their vassal, the Bulgarians soon rose up in revolt and joined the fight against the Ottomans at the Battle of Nicopolis. Though it ended in disaster, this shows us that in order to win the path towards freedom we need to use subterfuge, and allow us to act against the Turks even if nominally vassals."
 BDN_idea5:0 "Buffer Zone"
 BDN_idea5_desc:0 "Between the 15th and 18th centuries Vidin acted as a buffer zone in the centuries-long wars between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. Repeated punitive expeditions by the Austrians and brutal crackdowns by the Ottomans depopulated the city at several times, yet, we were always able to rise up again from the ashes. No matter the enemy, we shall never waver in our resolve."
 BDN_idea6:0 "Martyrs on the Altar"
 BDN_idea6_desc:0 "In 1806, during the rule of former Janissary Osman Pazvantoglu, he captured several hundred laymen and priests from Vidin and the surrounding areas, and imprisoned the priests and Bishop Kalinik in the Church of St. Peter, and later slaughtered them before the altar. The martyrdom of the holy men reminds us to never waver in our faith and determination to maintain independence."
 BDN_idea7:0 "The Defense of Vidin"
 BDN_idea7_desc:0 "During the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, repeated attempts to conquer Vidin by the Kingdom of Serbia failed, and its successful defense of the city, organized by Atanas Uzunov, allowed the Bulgarian army to go on the offensive and win the war decisively in Bulgaria's favor."

 DRJ_idea1:0 "Coastal Principality"
 DRJ_idea1_desc:0 "The weakness of the central government in the Bulgarian kingdom in the 14th century led to the loss of many territories, and some local feudal lords practically severed their subordinate relations with the king. In the middle of the century, this also happened with Dobruja, which the Bulgarian boyar Balik , with the help of his brothers Theodor and Dobrotitsa, turned into an independent feudal principality with Karvuna as its capital. Knowing that destiny is in our hands rather than that of distant overlords gives our people newfound security."
 DRJ_idea2:0 "Breadbasket of Eastern Bulgaria"
 DRJ_idea2_desc:0 "As a traditional breadbasket, Dobruja supplied wheat to Constantinople mostly via the major ports of Varna and Kaliakra frequented by the Genoese and Venetian fleets. This state of affairs not only ensures we always have enough supplies for our armies, but also increases our trade efficiency."
 DRJ_idea3:0 "Monetary Independence"
 DRJ_idea3_desc:0 "As chaos grippled the Empire of Bulgaria, the breakaway principality of Dobruja sought to mint its own coins in order to achieve full independence and stabilize the economy. In these troubled times this allows us to better manage our banks and provinces."
 DRJ_idea4:0 "Sail the Black Sea"
 DRJ_idea4_desc:0 "Unlike the other Bulgarian principalities we have the benefit of having a coast, from which we can launch a powerful fleet to serve our interests in the region. Be it protecting trade or defending against hostile invaders navy should be one of our top priorities."
 DRJ_idea5:0 "Hoist the Black Flag"

 DRJ_idea6:0 "Seaside Strongholds"
 DRJ_idea6_desc:0 "The coastal strongholds of Dobruja, notably the Kaliakra Fortress offer us much needed protection from enemy raids. As the Turks in the region grow more hostile it is of utmost importance that we keep these strongholds manned and maintained, lest our enemy catches us unprepared."
 DRJ_idea7:0 "Allies Overseas"
 DRJ_idea7_desc:0 "Our conflicted relations with the Genoese and Byzantines do allow us to find allies in unlikely places: the Republic of Venice is known for having hostile relations with both of those powers, so it would be in our best interest to seek an alliance with them."

Even though this region was hotly contested between Byzantines, Serbs and Bulgarians the despotate managed to retain independence until being forced into vassalage by the Ottomans following the Battle of Maritsa in 1371."
 VBZ_idea2:0 "Multi-ethnic Society"
 VBZ_idea2_desc:0 "Macedonia has seen many different peoples settle in the area, from Greeks to Illyrians, from Bulgarians to Serbs. Even though the area has a significant Bulgarian majority today it is still important that we maintain harmony between rulers and subjects, irrespective of their country of origin."
 VBZ_idea3:0 "Rugged Landscape"
 VBZ_idea3_desc:0 "Macedonia is a rugged landscape with several mountains and hills, all of which contribute to warfare in this area being quite difficult. Fortunately, this also means that our troops have had enough experience in mastering such landscapes and do not suffer as much attrition from it."
 VBZ_idea4:0 "Coin Minting in Macedonia"
 VBZ_idea4_desc:0 "As independent rulers of Velbazhd, the Dragas brothers had their own government and minted coins according to the Nemanjic style. These actions allowed the despotate to achieve not just stability but also legitimacy by using tried and trued methods of past dynasties."
 VBZ_idea5:0 "Pacifying our Borders"
 VBZ_idea5_desc:0 "As our hostile neighbors hold lands in southern and western Macedonia, as well as Serbia and Bulgaria, it is in our best interest to claim these lands for ourselves in order to secure our border and prevent the Turks from ever thinking they can treat us as a mere vassal ever again."
 VBZ_idea6:0 "Soldiers of all Kinds"
 VBZ_idea6_desc:0 "Being a hotly contested area between several empires, there are many disgruntled soldiers who used to work in their armies who now perform their services as mercenaries. It would be in our best interest to enlist these experienced men for our cause."
 VBZ_idea7:0 "Great Descendants"
 VBZ_idea7_desc:0 "Although the Dragas family wisely ruled the Despotate of Velbazhd, their dynasty had even greater successors, and those included Constantine XI, the last Byzantine Emperor, and Ivan the Terrible of Russia.

 SZK_idea2:0 "Warrior Castes"
 SZK_idea2_desc:0 "Our society is split into three groups. The commoners (or pixidarii) hold small parcels of land and fight as foot soldiers. The wealthier primipili act as mounted warriors. Finally, the high-ranking primores represent the highest hierarchy in Székely society."
 SZK_idea3:0 "Széks"
 SZK_idea3_desc:0 "The Székely administrative units were known as széks (or seats) from the middle of the 14th century. Each seat was headed by two elected officials, the lieutenant (maior exercitus) and the seat judge (iudex terrestris). Theoretically, lieutenants were responsible for the military affairs and seat judges administered justice, but lieutenants also heard legal disputes. Both seat judges and lieutenants heard disputes together with twelve jurors."
 SZK_idea4:0 "Resisting Centralization"
 SZK_idea4_desc:0 "Stephen Báthory, Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys, made several attempts to reduce the autonomy of the seats in the early 1490s, accusing many primores of high treason. He confiscated their estates and forced Székely heiresses to marry his retainers. Fortunately, through perseverance and persuasion, we have convinced the King of Hungary to replace this troublesome official. This precedent well shows us that the path to lasting prosperity lies in the pen as much as it does in the sword."
 SZK_idea5:0 "Push Back the Turks"

 SZK_idea6_desc:0 "Repeated attempts by the Habsburg monarchy to incorporate Transylvania have not gone unnoticed among the Székelys and many are anxious to defend our homeland against these arrogant conquerors. As we can no longer count on the protection of the old Kingdom of Hungary it is important to assert our control over the entirety of Carpathia in order to defend the frontier from the enemy rather than our doorstep."

 KYL_idea5:0 "Volkskirche"
 KYL_idea5_desc:0 "Under the influence of Johannes Honterus, the great majority of the Transylvanian Saxons embraced the new creed of Martin Luther during the Protestant Reformation.

We pride ourselves on our autonomy even as we're surrounded by much greater states than us."
 VDN_idea2:0 "Bishophric of Verdun"
 VDN_idea2_desc:0 "At the beginning of the 4th century, Verdun was evangelized by Saint Sanctin who had the first church dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul built on Mount St. Vanne. It is at this point that our city became the seat of the bishopric of Verdun with Sanctin himself as its first bishop. This proud bishophric is still going strong to this day thanks to our piety and efficient management."
 VDN_idea3:0 "Flowering Trade"
 VDN_idea3_desc:0 "Verdun was always a prosperous city which traded in metals, wines, fabrics, cereals and spices with the countries in the north.

 VDN_idea4:0 "Center of Arts"
 VDN_idea4_desc:0 "During the Middle Ages Verdun built a reputation as a city of great importance to the arts, thanks to its goldsmithing and its production of illuminated manuscripts and Vitreous enamel. One of our most celebrated artists was Nicholas of Verdun, one of the most famous goldsmiths and enamelists of the Middle Ages. He was a major figure in Romanesque art, and the leading figure of Mosan art in his day, creating shrines, figurines and candlesticks decorated with precious stones and traveling around Europe to fulfill major commissions. His legacy and that of the other artists ensures that our city is one of major prestige thanks to attracting like-minded individuals."
 VDN_idea5:0 "The Free City of Verdun"
 VDN_idea5_desc:0 "Occupied by the war, the kings of France no longer take care of guarding our city, leaving the Empire to restore its authority there. In 1374, Verdun thus obtained the title of free city of Empire, placed under the direct supervision of the emperor. This newfound sense of security allowed us to develop our institutions and city."
 VDN_idea6:0 "French Influence"
 VDN_idea6_desc:0 "Even if the city remains a land of Empire and the bishop a Prince of Empire, the city is increasingly coming under French influence, because of the language, the origin of the bishops and religious orders, the style of architecture and the economy (use of currencies and commercial relations). In addition, the Holy Roman Empire's weak central leadership means a lack of protection for the territory of the cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun against looters. Perhaps our heart truly lies with France in the end, but separating the realms of France and Germany means it is in our best interests to maintain positive relations with both."
 VDN_idea7:0 "Fortify the City"
 VDN_idea7_desc:0 "From 1624 to 1636, a large bastioned citadel was constructed on the site of the Abbey of Saint Vanne. In 1670, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban visited Verdun and drew up an ambitious scheme to fortify the whole city. It is important that we carry out these schemes in order to make sure our city will be able to resist any siege until reinforcements arrive."

Today we are a proud republic, but any kind of government will work well in the hands of our capable administrators."
 MTZ_idea2:0 "Within the Empire"
 MTZ_idea2_desc:0 "The status of Free City in the empire grants us significant priviledges, and being situated at the crossroads between France and Germany brings important diplomatic opportunities. Because we have long been considered a buffer area, it is here that Emperor Charles IV in 1354 and 1356 held diets, promulgating the Golden Bull decree of 1356 , fixing important constitutional aspects of the Holy Roman Empire. Even if many might seem our priviledges as unfair advantages, it is important to keep working within the Empire for our own goals."

Even today many writers and thinkers flock to Metz for a variety of reasons.

Their adherents established a Gymnasium, headed by Johannes Sturm, made into a University in the following century. Strasbourg thus became a centre of humanist scholarship and early book-printing in the Holy Roman Empire, and its intellectual and political influence contributed much to the establishment of Protestantism as an accepted denomination in the southwest of Germany.

The presence of these artists and the heavy Western and especially Venetian influence led to the flowering of an art movement later referred to as the Cretan School, which remained the most prestigious form of Greek art for several centuries. The most prominent artist of this period was Doménikos Theotokópoulos, who expertly combined Eastern and Western techniques to produce highly innovative works. "
 CRT_idea6:0 "Riches of the Mediterranean"
 CRT_idea6_desc:0 "Crete has always been a haven for pirates and privateers, due to its central location in the Mediterranean giving it an extremely important position in the sea trade. The jagged coastlines of Crete provide ample hiding places for pirate vessels and while this could prove problematic to us, we may choose to employ some of these people to instead work for us."
 CRT_idea7:0 "Support the Greek Revolution"

 GLC_idea2:0 "Shemyaka Hills"
 GLC_idea2_desc:0 "The early medieval earthen ramparts were further fortified in the early 15th and 16th centuries and have since become known as the Shemyaka Hills. These fortifications protect our city from our many enemies to the west and east as they seek to make Russia their own."
 GLC_idea3:0 "Galich Golden Age"
 GLC_idea3_desc:0 "The prosperity given to use by trade has allowed our city to prosper and acquire potential new buyers as our goods head to Moscow directly. Using this influence we will be able to further cement our role as one of the leading trade hubs in the region, outcompeting our rivals through reputation rather than brute strength."
 GLC_idea4:0 "The Fur Trade"
 GLC_idea4_desc:0 "Salt at this point is not the only good we have begun trading, as the many furs that arrive to us from the east are in high demand in the European market. These new trade routes for fur as well as the recently introduced commerce of fish ensure oru goods will arrive to far away lands and increase our reputation considerably."
 GLC_idea5:0 "Kazan Raids"
 GLC_idea5_desc:0 "As open war broke out between the principalities of Russia and the Kazan Sultanate to the East, the lands of Galich were subjected to heavy damage because of Kazan incursions into the region however, thanks to our fortifications, they were never able to take the city itself. As we were able to triumph in these difficult times it has become apparent to our people that we must never waver in our determination."
 GLC_idea6:0 "Orthodox Monasteries"
 GLC_idea6_desc:0 "Many monasteries dot the landscape in and around Galich. The most noteworthy one among them remains the Paisiev Monastery, founded in the early 14th century and featuring a 16th-century five-domed cathedral and a three-domed church from 1642. It is thanks to these wonderful monasteries that our people feel united in their faith."
 GLC_idea7:0 "On the Offensive"
 GLC_idea7_desc:0 "With the Kazan threat neutralized the importance of Galich as a defensive position declined. This however has not resulted in a loss of importance for us, and even though we are now safer from invasion we deem it fundamental to set up a strong army capable of taking the fight to the enemy rather than wait for them to pillage our lands again."

Continuing this development will confirm our status as a Scandinavian power."
 GTA_idea2:0 "Annex Smaland"
 GTA_idea2_desc:0 "Several small counties to the south enjoyed too much independence in times past and were therefore integrated into our kingdom, bringing us more wealth and allowing us to re-organize our administration. It is important to get these provinces back into the fold and utilize our administrative capabilities in order to further continue our expansion in Scandinavia."
 GTA_idea3:0 "Between Denmark and Sweden"
 GTA_idea3_desc:0 "The Kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden have by far become the dominant powers in Scandinavia, and both of them seek to influence the internal politics of Gotaland to their advantage.

 GTA_idea4:0 "Natural Barriers"

 GTA_idea5_desc:0 "Great wealth passes through the Baltic Sea, and the city of Kalmar is strategically situated on the coastline of Smaland as one of the most important ports of Scandinavia. Through here pass many trade caravans and the city is quickly becoming a major center for export of iron. These commercial links are allowing us to become a real power in the Baltic Sea trade."
 GTA_idea6:0 "Seize the Islands"
 GTA_idea6_desc:0 "In order to affirm our role as the dominant power in the Baltic Sea it is of vital importance to seize many of the islands that are used as trading outposts and military strongholds, including Oland just off the coast but also Goatland and Bornholm. With these possessions and a strong fleet nobody will be able to match our might at sea."
 GTA_idea7:0 "Legend of Beowulf"

 HAW_idea6:0 "Links to the Maghreb"
 HAW_idea6_desc:0 "Although they lack the importance that we have in Upper Egypt, many members of our tribes nonetheless continue to live in many places in the Maghreb to this day. Linking up to them would allow us to foster closer relations with the countries in that region."
 HAW_idea7:0 "Defend from the Egyptians"
 HAW_idea7_desc:0 "The Egyptian army under Ibrahim Pasha, having already finished off the Mamluks, is now heading in our direction in an attempt to end our autonomy once and for all.

 PDV_idea3:0 "Communal Independence"
 PDV_idea3_desc:0 "Starting from the XI century the position of Padua as one of the key cities of the Northeast was secured thanks to a steady territorial expansion, incorporating many small neighboring towns, and allowing the city to defend itself from hostile invaders from Venice, Vicenza and Verona. Among Padua's celebrated victories, the Battle of Castagnaro is noteworthy as a great military victory and one of the most well known battles of the 'Condottieri age'."
 PDV_idea4:0 "St. Anthony of Padua"
 PDV_idea4_desc:0 "The Portuguese Saint Anthony, renowed for his powerful preaching, expert knowledge of scripture, and undying love and devotion to the poor and the sick, worked and lived for a long time in Padua, and died there in 1231. His veneration spread widely after his death, becoming the patron saint of Padua and later having many churches built in his name in the Portuguese empire, as well as a great Basilica in Padua itself. Looking at his piety and knowledge of the scriptures as an example will surely increase the resolve of our missionaries."
 PDV_idea5:0 "The Padoan Renaissance"
 PDV_idea5_desc:0 "Padua has had a long tradition of supporting artists, and the arrival of famed florentine sculptor Donatello in 1443 triggered a new wave of artistic works in the city, which had already garnered fame thanks to Giotto's work in the XIV century. The Renaissance in Padua led to great development in the entire region as the ideas and techniques later spread to Venice and other cities, and Padua is considered to be along with Florence and Urbino as among the most important early centers of the movement."

Early on it became an important teaching centre for Aristotelism, and later it attracted brilliant inventors and thinkers such as Galileo Galilei. We must make sure to continue this time-honored tradition and keep our nation at the forefront of science and discovery."
 PDV_idea7:0 "City Expansion"

 bel_trappist_orders_desc:0 "The lands of Belgium are rather famous for their trappist orders. Their purpose as a religious order has mainly been to unite the people in the region, but also to provide sustenance to the people by brewing beer. This allows us to properly field armies loyal to our cause."
 bel_divided_peoples:0 "A Divided People"
 bel_divided_peoples_desc:0 "Belgium is a diverse region with many cultural and linguistic ties. The Walloons in the south have Latin ties, and Flemish in the north being Germanic, with both groups having several dialects and cultural differences. The one thing that unites us, however, is our faith, which we must take advantage of if we want to stabilize our nation."
 bel_flemish_scientists:0 "Flemish Scientists"
 bel_flemish_scientists_desc:0 "The region of Flanders has historically housed many famous scientists and cartographers, such as anatomist and physician Vesalius, botanist Dodoens, and the mathematician Stevin. As well, the cartographer Gerardus Mercator, was Flemish. Mercator also had a very famous Brabantian apprentice in Abraham Ortelius, who went on to create the Typus Orbis Terrarum. And we must admit that, certainly, the Typus projection is ultimately the best projection there is."
 bel_constitutionalism:0 "Belgian Constitutionalism"

 bel_redevelop_brugge_desc:0 "The city of Brugge was a glorious city with a rich history, having its golden age during the 12th to 15th centuries due to Hanseatic trade, as well as housing the court of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. Issues came in the 16th Century however: The Golden inlet, on which it was situated, started silting, the Hansa declined and the city fell under Habsburg rule, resulting in a drastic decline. As the discovery of the New World has attracted many seafarers to seek their fortune overseas, it necessitates the return of Brugge as a great trade center and, as a major colonial port, in this glorious day and age."

 bel_independence:0 "Independence from the French"
 bel_independence_desc:0 "The French King has always seen our lands as their own possessions, going great lengths in their attempts at seizing otherwise Imperial lands. Their ambition is to put us under their rule, along with the rest that is south of the Rhine river. If we are to resist their influence, there is little doubt that we cannot do this alone. We must seek strong supporters for our independence, lest we end up French, rather than Belgian."

 koi_mixed_heritage_desc:0 "The violence of the Reformation has reared its ugly head in our fair kingdom for far too long, and we have learned the hard way that, come what may, the best way to rule Ireland is to work with the native Gaels, not against them. Granting emancipation to all heretic denominations in the nation will unite us, so that we may shift our focus to more pressing concerns."

 koi_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "While we have much in common with the Gaelic Irish, there are also many points of departure between our peoples. To assure them that our differences are surmountable, and thus forestall any whispers of rebellion, we should take inspiration from our English cousins and proclaim our own Irish Bill of Rights."
 koi_anglo_rapprochement:0 "Anglo Rapprochement"
 koi_anglo_rapprochement_desc:0 "To better secure our borders from the depredations of England, we should resort to diplomacy. By attempting to build on the common ground of our shared heritage, it may be possible to make allies of our former enemies.

 celts_monastic_schools_desc:0 "In the past, our monasteries served not only as centers of religion, but also as centers of scholarship. Unique in Christendom, our monasticism was permeable.

Due to cultural difference however, these Moriscos settled on the other side of the Bou Regreg in Rabat. Using Rabat as a seat of operations they raided the shipping routes of the Atlantic, seizing ships for goods and captives. The corsairs become known as the Salé Rovers, with Rabat becoming known as \"New Salé\" by the English."

 #mor_restore_almohad_caliphate_desc:0 "Once, the Almohads ruled a Berber caliphate that controlled much of al-Andalus. Then the Iberian Kingdoms began their Reconquista, reducing Muslim rule in al-Andalus to what came to be the Emirate of Granada. While many attempts at re-establishing rule over al-Andalus have been unsuccessful, we shall make sure to succeed where others have failed and let Islamic rule return to Iberia and beyond!"

 american_innovation_btc_desc:0 "The United States population had some noteworthy advantages such as being former British subjects, having high English literacy skills, strong British institutions on courts, laws, right to vote, protection of property rights and relevant contact among the British innovators of the industrial revolution.\n\nThis unique situation allowed the rapid industrialisation of the country and the lack of workers provided an incentive to mechanize some tasks, which shaped the American spirit of innovation on not just industry, but on science and technology and contributed to its distinct political institutions, social structure, educational system, and cultural identity."
 usa_immigration_btc:0 "European Immigration"
 usa_immigration_btc_desc:0 "The United States was a big, relatively empty and still young country. It had the land to lease and the resources to exploit, it just needed the workers.\n\nTired from war, repressive absolutist monarchs and economic regression, Europeans from all over the continent began migrating to the prosperous American republic. Although relatively small in numbers at first, immigration saw a notorious increase in the 19th century, amounting to more than 30 million European migrants between 1836 and 1914."

 evangelization_america_btc_desc:0 "Inter Caetera was not the only papal bull granted to us by His Holiness. Another 4 bulls followed that would focus on how to treat, and most importantly, evangelize natives in America.\n\nThese bulls granted Spanish monarchs certain rights regarding the selection and examination of the priests elected to go to the missions. Monarchs would be empowered with a veto right in this regard. The bulls also granted the Spanish crown many other responsabilities and duties that otherwise would be exclusive to the Church, such as organising the churches in American colonies, tithing, decide where and when to build new churches and cathedrals and the ability to present possible candidates for ecclesiastical positions."

 spanish_emigration_btc_desc:0 "Still not recovered from the previous century's Black Death, ravaged by wars and religious unrest and the economical depression caused by the precious metals shortage during the Great Bullion Famine, European commoners and lesser nobility were in a dire situation.\n\nThe Discovery of America by Columbus at the end of the 15th century and the colonial enterprises started by the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies granted an opportunity to Europeans to leave everything behind and emigrate to the New World with the hopes of a new beginning.\n\nBecause of this and events like the expulsion of Sephardic Jews and Moriscos in 1492 and 1609 respectively, by 1520 over 20.000 Spaniards would have settled just in Santo Domingo alone. Over 2 million Spaniards would emigrate to Argentina between the 16th and 19th centuries, over 500.000 to Colombia, and many more millions would join the transatlantic emigration route."
 universal_monarchy_btc:0 "Universal Monarchy"
 universal_monarchy_btc_desc:0 "The concept of a universal monarchy or empire is not new; many empires of antiquity claimed or tried to be hegemons, but all of them failed or died.\n\nThe empire of Carlos V, Holy Roman Emperor and first Habsburg king of Spain, stretched across most of America and inherited vast amount of territories around Europe, establishing Spain as the first global empire in history. Under Philip II, Carlos V's successor, Spain, rather than the Habsburg empire, was identified as the most powerful nation in the world, easily eclipsing France and England, retaining its position of dominance with apparent ease despite attacks from Northern European states."
 tercios_btc:0 "Tercios"
 tercios_btc_desc:0 "Tercios were military units under the Habsburg monarchs of Spain. Famed for their stamina in battle, Tercios formed the backbone of the Spanish army between the 15th and 17th centuries and were crucial to maintain land hegemony, sometimes even maritime, of the Spanish Empire.\n\nTercios were considered a 'renaissance' of infantry in the battlefield, comparable to Roman legions and Macedonian hoplites. They were the first modern European army due to Tercio units being comprised of professional volunteers, rather than levies or mercenaries, and their pioneer usage of combined arms, being the first to efficiently mix pikes with firearms.\n\nThe emphasis on maintaining a high number of 'viejos soldados' (veterans), together with the particular personality imprinted on them by the proud hidalgos of the lower nobility that nurtured them, made the tercios for more than two centuries the best infantry in Europe."
 #British - English tweak
 gbr_new_model_army:0 "New Model Army"
 gbr_new_model_army_desc:0 "The New Model Army was the army raised by the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War in the 17th century. Unlike other armies raised for previous conflicts, the New Model Army was intended to be liable for service anywhere in the country, including Ireland and Scotland, rather than being tied to a single area or garrison. Due to the deeply Puritan religious beliefs held by many veterans who formed it, the army's leaders were prohibited from having seats in either the House of Lords or House of Commons.\n\nAs a result of this separation between political and military life, the army's generals became a very professional officer corps and the New Model Army turned into a full-time professional army, the first in the three kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland, proving supreme in the field.\n\nAlthough eventually disbanded by Charles II after the restoration, many of its regiments were integrated into what was now the British Army, with its legacy of a smaller, highly professional army living on to this day."

They constituted major educational and economical centers in England.\n\nHowever, after the Reformation took hold in England, causing internal and external social conflict, monasteries were suddenly dissolved and sold by Henry VIII after a dispute with the Papacy leaving them in a decrepit state, no longer an influential institution. To tackle this monasteries were restored and were used to establish many grammar schools that together with the introduction of the printing press helped England significantly increase its literacy."
 eng_tudor_poor_laws:0 "Tudor Poor Laws"
 eng_tudor_poor_laws_desc:0 "Poverty in England was an issue since early 15th century already. A combination of poor crops, black death and heavy economical burden by the Hundred Years Wars led to an economical debacle lasting from around 1440 to the 1480s.\n\nDespite the relatively peaceful era under the Tudor, the dissolution of monasteries by Henry VIII, which served as providers of social welfare, only worsened the already widespread problem of poverty, which led the Tudor monarchs to enact a series of 'Poor Laws' tackling issues such as street beggars or vagabonds.\n\nHowever these laws had a draconian side where instead of helping the poor through altruism under Christian charity, able-bodied beggars and vagabonds were targeted by punishments if they beg instead of work, some of them so harsh officers of the law often were relunctant to enforce them. At the same time additional Poor Laws were passed requiring parishes to have a store of 'wool, hemp, flax, iron', so that the poor could be set to work, creating a new effective and cheap workforce."

If at every coronation all of our nobles pledge their allegiance to our ruler, their support of our reign will be guaranteed, legitimizing our sovereignty."
 STY_idea_2: "Military Frontier"
 STY_idea_2_desc: "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it. The solution we have hit upon it to make generous land grants on the frontier to build up a professional military class. Not only will this ensure our frontier is adequately defended at a reasonable price but these men will be available for other tasks."
 STY_idea_3: "Rezeß von Wien"
 STY_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, there were exclaves of clerical territories amidst Styria. We have been able to negotiate an agreement with the corresponding rulers.

However, these territories will still belong to their lordships, and they will still be responsible for all judicial matters."
 STY_idea_4: "Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat"
 STY_idea_4_desc: "Various raids have shown that we need to centralize our defenses in order to react properly. We will found the Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat in which we will convene and counsel with our territorial estates close to the border. This will help to decide with as much information as possible, so that our defensive actions will be more organized."
 STY_idea_5: "Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft"
 STY_idea_5_desc: "For a long time our iron industry was decentralized and was split into many different facilities often taking care of only one production step. Whereas, the foundation of the Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft will lead to the whole production and trade being managed centrally benefiting our iron production."
 STY_idea_6: "Landeszeughaus"
 STY_idea_6_desc: "From now on, our weaponry and military equipment will be stored in the newly built Landeszeughaus of Graz. With its capacity to store equipment for about 16,000 soldiers, it is the biggest armory of the world and will greatly reduce our storage costs."

 TIR_idea_5: "Neighboring With Italy"
 TIR_idea_5_desc: "Though we are proud of ourselves and want to spread our culture, we are too close to Italy and people from there are migrating to our nation. If we tolerate them we can avoid ruthless rebellions."
 TIR_idea_6: "Condottieri From Italy"
 TIR_idea_6_desc: "Everybody has a talent. And Italians' talent is being mercenaries. They fight war after war for a little money and yet they don't complain a single time. We may as well put them into our service in order to protect our Alps."
 TIR_idea_7: "Harsh Alpine Winter"
 TIR_idea_7_desc: "Winter is an enemy for every nation that is in a war. But winters in the Alps are ten times more severe. It creates too many troubles for the nations who dare to cross the Alps. Because of this, we must use the Alps to create attrition for our enemies."
