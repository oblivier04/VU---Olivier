In Sweden, a particular organisation known as the Birkarls arose and was responsible for the taxation of the Sami people, to the point of complete monopoly. It is notable that this was not a de jure position that they held, but rather a de facto one, signifying the autonomous rule of the monarch at the time, who in fact resided in Denmark. Nevertheless, they provided the monarch with valuable Sami furs that benefitted the nation. The status quo was kept until the Centralization reforms of Gustav Vasa, who figured that removing the middle hand that were the Birkarls would greatly increase the size of the Swedish treasury."

Mentioned specifically as early as the year 98 by the Roman historian Tacitus,  'Baltic Amber', as it is known, is so particularly abundant in the area that it washes up on the shoreline all on its own. The semi-precious stone is so abundant that despite being collected since distant antiquity, production continued to increase to the point that by the 18th century, it is believe that 95% of all finshed amber produced worldwide originated from this region."

From humble beginning in the 1200s with a few small operations, the city would grow to contain 500 breweries by the middle of the 16th century, supplying much of northern Europe with the finest beer."

 desc_bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula positions it ideal to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly tranformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."

Following the marriage, the Aquitaine region suddenly found itself within the sprawling Angevin Empire, which had a strong taste for quality wine but little other land suitable for intensive viticulture. As a result, the industry was heavily developed and by the mid 1100s Bordeaux was already exporting vast quantities of wine, most commonly a rosé known as 'claret', to northwestern Europe."
